## Master

### Bug Fixes

- Swift toolchains 'latest' version is no longer shown in `swiftenv versions`
  on OS X.
- Fixes a problem where `swiftenv install` on Linux will incorrectly
  determine URL for the Swift binaries.


## 0.5.0

### Enhancements

- The `swift-` prefix for versions is now optional.
- `swiftenv install` now has a `--list` option:

    ```shell
    $ swiftenv install --list
    ```

- `swiftenv install` is capable of building Swift `2.2-dev` from source.
- `swiftenv install` now takes URLs to a Swift binary package.
- `swiftenv install` was updated to use the new binary swift.org release URLs.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixes an issue where using shims would suppress error messages when the
  configured version was not installed.
- Allows the completion to work when using swiftenv installed from Homebrew.

## 0.4.0

### Enhancements

- Adds support for command and argument completions.

## 0.3.2

### Bug Fixes

- Performance improvement when running on OS X. In previous versions, during
  initialisation swiftenv with rehash the environment, unfortunately once we
  added support for Xcode's Swift there was a huge negative performance impact
  due to Xcode tools taking large amount of time due to the underlying commands
  being tremendously slow.

## 0.3.1

### Bug Fixes

- Improved error reporting when trying to install a non-existent Swift version.
- When a shim command isn't found in version, search PATH too. This fixes a
  problem when using swiftenv on OS X with Xcode installed while your Swift
  version is configured to a snapshot from swift.org.
